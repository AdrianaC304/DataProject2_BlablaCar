## PubSub

As a fist step, go to the [Google Pub/Sub console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub) and **create a topic**, making sure to check the option to create a default subscription. This topic will be responsible for collecting the data sent by the traffic camera for further processing.
